# Calculator Program - Developer Guide

---

## Overview

A simple Calculator made in Python to perform basic arithmetic operations including: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. This program accepts 2 numbers and an operator through user input in the terminal.

---

## Logic

1. User inputs the first number, operator, and second number.
2. Program check the operator and calls the correct function.
3. Error handling occurs (invalid operator, division by zero).
4. Displays the result.

## Usage Example

##### Correct Usage:

Enter first number: 12
Enter operator (+, -, \*, /): +
Enter second number: 5
Result: 17.0

##### Error case:

Enter first number: 10
Enter operator (+, -, _, /): _
Enter second number: 0
Result Error: Division by zero

## Future Improvements

- Add more operations (%, exponents)
- Input Validation
- GUI version with Tkinter
- Add continuous operations (1 + 1 = 2, 2 - 1 = 1)

### Feedback

- Add more operators
- Make a GUI Version
- It functions as it should
